## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

To deploy the Personal Finance Dashboard on your local machine or on AWS EC2, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyedNasir9/personal-finance-dashboard.git
cd personal-finance-dashboard
2. Install dependencies and run the app locally:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm start
This will start the app on http://localhost:3000.

Cloud Deployment (AWS EC2):
Launch EC2 Instance:
Go to AWS EC2 ‚Üí Launch Instance ‚Üí Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI ‚Üí Configure security groups to allow ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

SSH into your EC2 Instance:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
Install Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
logout && log back in
Install Docker Compose:
bash
Copy code
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Clone the repository and deploy:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SyedNasir9/personal-finance-dashboard.git
cd personal-finance-dashboard
docker-compose up -d
Now, your app will be live on your EC2 instance's public IP.

üìà Monitoring Dashboard Guide
To monitor the performance of your app using Prometheus and Grafana, follow these steps:

1. Prometheus:
Prometheus scrapes metrics from the app‚Äôs NGINX server to monitor HTTP request rates and server performance.

Access Prometheus at http://localhost:9090 (or your EC2 IP if deployed).

2. Grafana:
Grafana is connected to Prometheus as a data source.

Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (or your EC2 IP if deployed).

Login using admin/admin.

Create dashboards to visualize metrics like requests, memory usage, and CPU load.

For example, you can create a dashboard to visualize the following NGINX metrics:

nginx_connections_active

nginx_connections_handled

nginx_http_requests_total

You can also create custom queries in Grafana to show specific metrics you are interested in.

ü©∫ Health Check Status Info
You can check the health status of the application by visiting the /health endpoint. This is helpful to verify that the application is running as expected.

Health Check Endpoint:
bash
Copy code
GET /health
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
If the health check fails, investigate the logs and metrics for any issues.
